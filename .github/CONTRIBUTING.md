# Contributing to Snapbooth

Hey there! üëã

I'm really glad you're interested in contributing to Snapbooth, that means a lot. I don't have much experience with frontend development, so I kept things pretty simple for this project as of now, using:

- Plain JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Node.js
- Tailwind CSS

I'd love to eventually update the project with something more modern, like **React** and **Vite**, if I get a chance to learn it. Totally open to ideas and improvements in the meantime!

## üöÄ Getting Started

Clone the GitHub repository and move into the project directory.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/VandalByte/snapbooth.git
cd snapbooth
```
Create a new virtual environment and activate it.
```sh
python -m venv .venv

# On Windows:
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
```
Install the python dependencies.

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Install the node dependencies and build Tailwind CSS.
```sh
npm install
npm run build
```
Now to update the CORS settings go to `app.py` find this  line
```
allow_origins=["https://snapbooth.onrender.com"],
```
and change it to:
```
allow_origins=["*"],
```

Next to update the frontend API URL go to `script.js` find the url
```
https://snapbooth.onrender.com/upload
```
and change it to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/upload
```

Start the FastAPI backend `app.py` in development mode.
```sh
fastapi dev app.py
```
Now open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000 to see the app running locally.

## üé® Code Style

Nothing too fancy just try to keep the style consistent with existing code. If you use Prettier or a linter, feel free to share your setup!

For **Python**, we use [black formatter](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for formatting and [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for sorting the imports. Please run your code through them before opening a pull request.

For everything else (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, etc.), we use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).
